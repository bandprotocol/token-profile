    "en": "Band Protocol offers a decentralized data oracle by making data readily available to be queried on-chain, using delegated proof of stake (dPoS) to ensure data integrity. It aims to be the go-to data infrastructure layer for Web 3.0 applications by providing decentralized, curated off-chain data to smart contracts through oracles managed by its dPoS consensus mechanism."
